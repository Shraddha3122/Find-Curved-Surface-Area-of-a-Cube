# Find-Curved-Surface-Area-of-a-Cube
A cube is a 3-dimensional box-like figure represented in the 3-dimensional plane. Cube has 6 squared-shape equal faces. Each face meets another face at 90 degrees each. Three sides of the cube meet at the same vertex. The curved surface area of a cube is the sum of the areas of all its faces, except its top and bottom faces.
